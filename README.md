## Directory of important files
- `Arduino/449_combine_pir_sound` currently contains the most up-to-date code skeleton for our process
- `Arduino/libraries` has all of the libraries needed to run the code
- non-integrated system tests are in the folder `Arduino` and are named self-explanatorily (I think)
